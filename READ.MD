This project is a simple book catalog website that displays books along with their cover, genre, and description. The goal of the site is to provide visitors with a clean and easy way to browse different books and learn basic information about each one. No user accounts, comments, or ratings are included — the site focuses only on presenting book details in a straightforward format.
The backend of this project is implemented with Express.js, while MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing book information.
